# Shoprab.
A project created by me for my own satisfaction and curiosity. It is an "Interactive, psychological web game with a shopping mechanic for powers".
# How I got The Idea.
- I actually got this idea from the game would you rather while playing in class. But to not copy that wholly i add a twist. I converted the powere in products in a shop which one needs to buy.
# How The Website Works.
- User starts at the landing page and clicks Start Now to enter the game.

- In the shop (game.html), they select powers, each costing voids and having a sacrifice.

- The void counter updates in real-time, preventing overspending.

- Clicking Checkout shows selected powers with costs and sacrifices on checkout.html.

- Accept Powers confirms the choices and redirects to a thank you page (thank.html).
